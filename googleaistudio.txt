# googleaistudio.txt - AI Book Writer Project Documentation and Changelog

## Project Objective:

To develop an AI-agentic system capable of writing a full-length novel, leveraging the yWriter7 project file format for organization and structure. The system will use a CrewAI framework with specialized agents for story planning, outlining, world-building, character development, prose generation, and editing. The goal is to create a workflow that not only generates a complete novel but also utilizes the features of yWriter7 to manage and organize the writing process effectively. The contents of this file is generated by and intended for use by Aistudio to retain information between aistudio prompts when context windows get too long. The user will update the txt file manually as changes are requested.

## Instructions for Updating this Changelog:

1.  **Timestamp Entries:**  Every time you make a significant change to the code or have a key insight, add a new entry at the **top** of this changelog, starting with a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -`. This ensures the changelog is in reverse chronological order (most recent entries at the top).

2.  **Comprehensive Documentation:** Each entry should thoroughly document:
    *   **Code Changes:** List files modified and concisely summarize *what* code was changed (be specific!).
    *   **Reasoning/Rationale:** Explain *why* the code changes were made. What problem were you solving? What enhancement were you implementing? What was your thought process?
    *   **Insights and Observations:** Document any important insights, observations, or key decisions made during development.
    *   **Next Steps/Action Items:** Outline immediate next steps or action items.
    *   **Challenges/Issues Encountered:** Note any challenges, errors, or unexpected behavior and how you addressed them (or plan to address them).

3.  **Be Specific and Clear:** Use precise and unambiguous language. Assume someone unfamiliar with the project will read this changelog.

4.  **Focus on Key Information:** Prioritize documenting architecturally significant changes, major issue resolutions, key insights, and progress in functionality.

5.  **Regular Updates are Key:** Update `googleaistudio.txt` after *each significant coding session* to keep the changelog current and maximize its value.

## Changelog: (New entries go here)

2025-01-26 21:30 - Implemented Scene Reordering Critic and Reviser Agents (agents.py, main.py), Fixed TaskOutput Access in main.py, Added Agent Communication Logging (main.py, agents.py)
    - **Code Changes:**
        *   Modified `Critic` agent in `agents.py` to include scene order evaluation in goal/backstory.
        *   Added "critic_task" for scene reordering in `create_chapter_tasks` in `main.py`.
        *   Updated "revise_task" to handle scene reordering and transitions.
        *   Inserted `critic_task` into `chapter_crew` task list.
        *   Corrected line 462 in `main.py` to access `chapter_content = write_task.output` (TaskOutput object directly).
        *   Added `comm_logger` and logging statements for agent communications in `main.py`.
        *   Removed prompt logging from `agents.py` (caused AttributeError).
    - **Reasoning/Rationale:**
        *   To enable scene-level outline planning and improve chapter structure and pacing based on user feedback.
        *   To allow for more dynamic chapter construction with location changes and multi-character threads.
        *   To align with yWriter7's scene-centric approach.
        *   To fix `AttributeError` and get chapter generation running again.
        *   To add agent communication logging for debugging and efficiency analysis.
    - **Insights/Observations:**
        *   Realized `_prepare_llm_message` is not a public method in CrewAI Agent (removed prompt logging for now - can revisit later with a different approach if needed).
        *   Need to test if Scene Reordering Critic is effective and if Reviser handles transitions correctly.
        *   Agent communication log will be crucial for analyzing agent interactions and identifying inefficiencies.
    - **Next Steps/Action Items:**
        *   Run `main.py` with these changes and provide logs (error output, debug print, agent_communication.log, agent prompt logs).
        *   Analyze logs to verify chapter output and agent behavior.
        *   Refine prompts for Critic and Reviser based on initial test runs.
